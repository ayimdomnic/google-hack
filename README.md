# Event Tutorial app for Ionic 2 and Firebase 3 with JS SDK

This one is easy to set up, first, make sure you have everything installed and up to date:

```bash
npm install -g cordova ionic@beta typings
```

After that just create a folder for the project and clone it:

```bash
mkdir eventApp
cd eventApp
git clone https://github.com/javebratt/event-tutorial.git .
```

After you clone it don't forget to install the node modules:

`npm install`

And the typings for Firebase `typings install --save firebase` (_this won't be necessary in beta12_)

Oh and we are using the camera plugin so: `ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-camera`
